Future Funk css style for Twitch.tv.

Gives Twitch.tv a Future Funk Theme. Finally works both logged-in and logged-out, and also with the Dark-theme enabled and disabled. Code has been completely overhauled and fixed. The code should no longer break as frequently as it did with every Twitch update.

Works also with FrankerFaceZ and BTTV extensions!
